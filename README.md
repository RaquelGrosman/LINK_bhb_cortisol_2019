PRA3006: Programming in the Life Sciences
------------------------------------------------------------

_Project Completed: December 2019_
---------------------------------

This repository has all the files used by one group of students, during the PRA3006 practical at the Maastricht Science Program;
The goal of this project was to combine SPARQL Queries, Javascript, and HTML to visualise the answer to a biological question on a web page.

_The biological question in this case was "What is the relationship between Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and Cortisol inside the human metabolism ?"_

The names of all group members are in the **"AUTHORS"** file.

The file containing the final version of our code is the **"FinalPage"** file;
This file has the complete code for the web page which was the concluding result of this project;
The code can directly be copy-pasted into a text file, saved as an html file, and openened in a browser;
As for the type of browser to use: we only tested the display of the web page on Brave, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge;
Apart from minor details on the page the Force Directed Graph and all of text appeares with all of these browsers.

There might be information on the web page that is pushed down by the SVG display;
Please make sure to scroll across the whole web page to see the whole of the contents.

Other files of importance which include SPARQL(Virtuoso) queries codes are;
**"kbPROTEINS_foruse"** file, which is the proteins related to ketone bodies query and;
**"CortisolPROTEINS_foruse"** file which is the proteins related to cortisol query.

Please note that all of the other code files were the build up of final code, therefore are not very relevant. 

_Open course, MIT License can be found in **"LICENSE"** file._
